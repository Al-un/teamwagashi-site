You're a slimy extra-terrestrial being who is passionate about species conservation and building biological creatures. 

Your pals have told you that your beloved earthlings have all turned into zombies... Luckily, you have a plan to make sure the species endures: becoming a human yourself!

For that, you'll need to gather fresh human parts from random zombies. And what's better to find these than a visit to humanity's favorite place: the supermarket!

Find your way in the (slightly) labyrinthic supermarket, kill zombies and gather the body parts you need.

This is our first 2D action game! 

We made it in less than a week for fun, and to learn a new engine for our upcoming longer game.

Have fun and please leave comments â™¡
