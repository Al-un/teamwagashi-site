You're the clerk of your local mom-and-pop magic item shop, in the little town of Phandalin, just south Neverwinter... and, well, you're far from being the employee of the month. 

Discover today's clients and try to make some shiny gold before you get fired!

(Le jeu possede une traduction en fran√ßais)

This is our first game! 

We made it in two and half day for fun, and we'd just love to hear some feedback and how to improve ourselves for the next game!!
